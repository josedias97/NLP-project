## Emotion detection

**MSc:** Data Science and Advanced Analytics, NOVA IMS   
**Grade:** 18 out of 20   

### Description
In this project, we took on the task of emotion detection, where the input is a sentence,
and the goal is to predict one label with the emotion expressed in that sentence.
We used a subset of the XED dataset for multiclass emotion detection, which consists of
English and Finnish movie subtitles from OPUS corpus, annotated with emotional polarity
and discrete emotions.   
The XED dataset originally contained multilabel annotations for discrete emotions, but to keep
things simpler, it was provided to us a single label dataset, extracted from the English dataset.
The sentence and the label are separated by a tab character (\t), and the labels are mapped
as follows:   
• 1: Anger   
• 2: Anticipation    
• 3: Disgust   
• 4: Fear   
• 5: Joy   
• 6: Sadness   
• 7: Surprise   
• 8: Trust
